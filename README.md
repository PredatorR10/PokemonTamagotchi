## About this project

This project is a simple game where the user can raise and take care of their own Pokemon, specificaly a charmander, and watch it evolve as the game progresses.  The player will have to use the "feed", "sleep", and "battle" buttons to take care of the Pokemon's needs, if any of them get to low the Pokemon will die.  The game has a hard time limit based around the Pokemon's age, which they will die once they are over the age of 40.  Charmander in Pokemon lore evolves at levels 16 and 36 so an evolution and level system was added tied to the "battle" button to reference this fact.

## Why I made this

I created this to put my coding skills to the test in creating a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.  Building something from the ground up was a fun opportunity to solidify the concepts I have learned thus far.
